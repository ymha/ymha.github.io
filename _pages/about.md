Hi, I'm Youngmok Ha.

I am an incoming PhD student in the Department of Bioengineering at Imperial College London in London, UK, currently on leave from my position as a Senior Researcher at the Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI) in Daejeon, South Korea, to pursue my doctoral studies. 
I received my Master’s degree from the Department of Information Security and my Bachelor’s degree from the College of Information & Communication (now the College of Informatics), both at Korea University in Seoul, South Korea.

My current research interests are at the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and security, with a focus on medical applications and devices. I also maintain a strong interest in optimization methodologies and distributed systems.
